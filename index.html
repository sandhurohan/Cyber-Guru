											<h3>Importance of Cyber Security</h3>
										</header>
											<br><a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
										Cybersecurity's importance is on the rise. Fundamentally, our society is more technologically reliant
										than ever before and there
										is no sign that this trend will slow. Personal data that could result in identity theft is now post
										ed to the public on our social media accounts. Sensitive information like social security numbers, 
										credit card information and bank account details are now stored in cloud storage services like 
										Dropbox or Google Drive.
										</p>
										<p>
										The fact of the matter is whether you are an individual, small business or large multinational, 
										you rely on computer systems every day. Pair this with the rise in cloud services, poor cloud servi
										ce security, smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT) and we have a myriad of cybersecurity threat
										s that didn't exist a few decades ago. We need to understand the difference between cybersecurity and 
										information security, even though the skillsets are becoming more similar.
