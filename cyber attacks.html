												<h3>Phishing</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Phishing is a scam in which a perpetrator sends an official looking e-mail message that atte
												mpts to obtain your personal and financial information. Some phishing e-mail messages ask you 
												to reply with your information; others direct you to a phony Web site, or a pop-up window that
												looks like a Web site, that collects the information.
											</p>
											<p>
												To help you protect yourself from phishing, we offer the following tips:<br>

												<strong>Guard against spam</strong> Be especially cautious of emails that: * Come from unrecognized senders.<br>
												Communicate personal information only via phone or secure web sites.<br>
												Do not click on links, download files or open attachments in emails from unknown senders.<br>

												lly block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way w
												hich is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cr
												yptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom 
												payment to decrypt them.
